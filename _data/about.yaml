  Analysis of Microtubule Catatastrophe

Abstract: >
  The purpose of this website is to investigate the dynamics of microtubule
  catastrophe, which is defined as the change in state from growth to shrinkage
  for a microtubule. The mode of investigation will be through the examination
  of the time between start of growth to catastrophe. This data was collected
  by labeling tubulin, the monomer that makes up a microtubule, using
  fluorescent markers. To ensure that the labels and laser light exposure
  did not affect the microtubule catastrophe dynamics, differential
  interference contrast (DIC) microscopy was used for both labeled and
  unlabeled tubulin.
Summary:  >
  Analysing the dynamics of microtubules is important because microtubules
  are essential in exploring intercellular space and moving organelles. This is
  important for a variety of cellular processes, including motility and mitosis.
